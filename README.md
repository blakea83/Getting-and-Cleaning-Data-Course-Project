Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
========================================

The repo for the John Hopkins Cleaning Data



1)	Downloaded the data file from the website

    download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip","project3.zip")

2)	unzipped downloaded file
    unzip("project3.zip")

3)	move to zipped directory 
    setwd("./UCI HAR Dataset")

4)	Read in training files for data, ID, and Activity
    trainx<-read.table("./train/X_train.txt")
    trainID<-read.table("./train/subject_train.txt")
    trainactivity<-read.table("./train/y_train.txt")

5)	Read in test files for data, ID, and Activity
    testx<-read.table("./test/X_test.txt")
    testID<-read.table("./test/subject_test.txt")
    testactivity<-read.table("./test/y_test.txt")

6)	Merge the training data together
    testx<-cbind(testID,testactivity,testx)
    
    
7)	Merge the test data together
    trainx<-cbind(trainID,trainactivity,trainx)


8)	Merge the data test
    combinedx<-rbind(testx,trainx)
    
9)	Get the labels for the data set.
    a<-read.table("./features.txt")

10)	Remove the extra column so we have a just a column of names
    a1<-a[,2]

11)	Create additional labels vector for identity and activity.
    a2<-c("ID","Activity")

3)	A1 is a factor so force to a character vector.
    a1<-as.character(a1)

14)	Combine activity and ID labels with the data labels
    a3<-c(a2,a1)
    
15)	Relabeled the extracted mean and std data frame
    colnames(combinedx)<-a3

16)	Find which columns have mean() and std() in the name.
    x1<-grep("mean()",a1)
	  x2<-grep("std()",a1)

17) Combine and sort the vectors that have mean and std in them.
    x3<-c(x1,x2)
    x4<-sort(x3)

18) Correcting for the vector numbers because the label vector was increased by 2 by adding in ID and Activity
    x5<-x4+2

19) Making sure the extracted data frame has the ID and activities column
    x6<-c(1,2,x5)

20) Extracting the columns with mean, std, ID, and activity from the larger data frame
    meanstd<-combinedx[,x6]

21) Read in the activiy labels
    activity<-read.table("./activity_labels.txt")

22) Chaning the activity table to a vector and making it a character vector
    activity<-activity[,2]
    activity=as.character(activity)

23) Removing activities from data frame amd converting the integer to character vector
	b1<-as.character(combinedx[,2])

24) taking the data frame and changing it to a character vector.  Revalue needs character vectors
	b2=as.character(b1[[1]]) 
	
25)	Changing the values in the activities column from numbers to names
    b2<-revalue(b1,c("1"=activity[1],"2"=activity[2],"3"=activity[3],"4"=activity[4],"5"=activity[5],"6"=activity[6]))

26) Replacing the activities column in the data frame with the new column in labels. 
    meanstd[,2]=b2

27) Sorting the data by ID and activity 
    d1<-group_by(meanstd,"ID","Activity")

28) Getting the labels of the data frame
    c2<-labels(c1)[2]

29) Converting the list extracted to a character vector
    c3=c2[[1]]

30) melting the data frame by ID and Activity
    c4<-melt(c1,ID=c3[1:2],measure.vars=c3[3:81])
31) Generating the average of each column for each activity of each subject
    d1<-ddply(meanstd,.(ID,Activity),numcolwise(mean))
  
32) write the tidy data table to a txt file with no row names
  write.table(d1,file="data.txt",sep=",",row.names=FALSE)
