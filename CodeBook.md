This is the Codebook for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.    The data being examined is unitless because it has been normalized.


The zip file of the samsung motion data was downloaded from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The downloaded file as unzipped.  

The trainx (training data), trainactivity (subject activity), trainID (training subjects),
testx (test data), testID (test subject ID) ,and testactivity (subject activity text files were read in as a tables.
The test tables (testx,testID, and testactivity) were merged to testx  The training tables (trainx, trainID, and trainactivity) were merged into trainx.
Next, the trainx and testx were merged into combinedx.
The lables were read from features.txt to a.
The columns names only were selected and sent to a1. a1 was forced to a character vector
A vector with ID and activity were created a2
a vector of a2 and a1 were created a3 which contained all the column names for the data set.
Combinedx's columns were named using a3.
A vector x1 was created with all the vector locations that had mean in them.
A vector x2 was created with the vector location that had std in them.
The vectors of the column locations x1 and x2 were combined to a new vector x3
THe vectors x1 and x2 used the vector that did not have ID or activity in them. So 2 was added to all the vector location
in x3.
The first and second locations were added to x3 so that the activity and ID columns will not be deleted.
a table meanstd was created using x3 to contain only the column's with mean and std were used.
an array activity was created that read in the activity lables from the data set.  
The row names were removed from activity and the vector was made into a character vector activity.
Created a vector b1 that was a character vector of the activity numbers from combinedx column 2.
b2 was created from b1; the activity numbers were converted to activity descriptions.
b2 replaced the column 2 in meanstd.
the average of each column for each activity of each subject, d1,  was found.
d1 was exported as a text file and placed in the grading folder.







The original experiment is described below.





Data Set Information:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset.


Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
